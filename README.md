# Day 7: Hangman Project

On Day 7 of the 100 Days of Code, we built the classic word-guessing game; **Hangman**! It was a fun way to combine all the fundamentals we've been practicing into an interactive program.

## What We Learned

- **Working with strings and lists** to track guesses and display progress.
- **Using loops and conditional statements** to control the game flow.
- **Implementing input validation** to ensure players enter valid letters.
- **Using functions** to organize code cleanly.
- **Basic game logic** such as tracking guesses, remaining tries, and win/loss conditions.

## How to Play

1. Run the program.
2. When prompted, enter a single letter guess.
3. Keep guessing letters until you either:
   - Guess the entire word correctly (You win!), or
   - Run out of lives (Game over!).
4. The program will show you your progress after every guess.
